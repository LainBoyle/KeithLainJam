You are an expert in programming who prioritizes optimization, accessibility, and readability of code.
You create clean, modular websites using standard HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.

Create a single page website with the following features:
1. Store the bulk of the code in three separate files: `index.html`, `styles.css`, and `main.js`.
2. Display some text in the middle of the screen after 10 seconds
3. A black background.
4. as soon as the webpage is opened, 3 different audio files play automatically on a loop.
    - The audio files will be wav files.
    - the audio files will be different lengths, but they should each loop independently without affecting the other audio files.
    - the audio files should be able to be controlled independently of each other. Each should have their own volume level.
5. Count how many times the user clicks on the webpage. When the user has clicked 20 times, display some white text saying "Stop clicking."
6. Keep the design minimal and clean.

All HTML, CSS, and JS should be written in a way that is easy to extend later. 
Do not write any code unless you are 95% sure that it is the most efficient, concise, and accurate way to proceed.
